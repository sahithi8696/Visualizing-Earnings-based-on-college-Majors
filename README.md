# Visualizing-Earnings-based-on-college-Majors
In this project,I will be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. I work with the cleaned dataset released on FiveThirtyEight's Github repo.

###### Using Data visualization techniques in Python, we explore the following questions
1. Which category of Majors have the most students?
2. What are the majors that have predominantly male students and the majors that have predominantly female students?
3. Does there exist any correlation betweem popular majors and student earnings?
4. What is the realtionship between share of women and student earnings?
